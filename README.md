- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nazia-Z
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about data analysis
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis through the Google Data Analytics certificate but I know I have long way to go. I've joined this forum to seek guidance as to what I should pursue next to develop my skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on basically anything that will help me learn more
- 📫 How to reach me on my email or the messenger here if there is one. I've yet to see how github works!
